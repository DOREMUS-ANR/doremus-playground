# DHT
Consists of a pair of datasets (from the BnF and the Philharmonie de Paris) containing each 238 musical works which are heteregeneous in their description. Particularly they manifest differences in description, such as multilingualism, differences in catalogs, differences in spelling, etc. The aim here is to determine if the interlinking tools are able to cope with these heterogeneities. The data is given in their original MARC format and in a version converted to DOREMUS RDF. The refDHT.rdf file contains the reference (ground truth) alignment between the works.
